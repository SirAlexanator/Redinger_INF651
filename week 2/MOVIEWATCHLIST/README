Project: Movie Watchlist Application
This is a real-time web application built with HTML, CSS (using Materialize framework), and vanilla JavaScript to manage a user's movie watchlist.

How to Interact with the Application
Add a Movie:

Type a movie title into the "Enter movie title" input field.

Click the "Add Movie" button (or press the Enter key while focused on the input).

The movie is immediately added to the "My Watchlist" section.

Remove a Movie (Mark as Watched):

Find the movie you want to remove in the list.

Click the green checkmark icon (check_circle_outline) next to the movie title.

The movie is instantly removed from the list, simulating the action of marking it as watched.
